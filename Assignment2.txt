Exercise 1

I committed the script to Git, so it should be there.

Exercise 2

When I call the function clear_screen() before its definition, I get a traceback error. The reason this happens
is because a function cannot be called before it is defined, otherwise, the computer does not know what that
function is supposed to do.

Exercise 3

When I place the definition of new_line() after it is called upon in other definition statements, it still runs
the program correctly. This is because the function call for clear_screen() which utilizes the new_line()
definition is still placed after the new_line() function is definied. If I were to place the new_line() definition
after the clear_screen() call, then a traceback error would occur.

Exercise 4

I finally got this one working, found out the problem was at first I hadn't definied the
cat_n_times() statement correctly, then I wasn't importing correctly because I was typing
in "import import_test" instead of "from import_test import * ". So, after correcting
everything, this is what I got:

>>> from import_test import *
>>> cat_n_times('spam', 7)
spamspamspamspamspamspamspam
>>> 

The import_test.py script I will commit to Git.

As for the Chapter3Extra.py script, I don't know where that is. Is that supposed to be
in Git or something? I couldn't find it.
