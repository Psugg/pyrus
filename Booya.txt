For Chapter3Extra.py

The order that I predict will print out is:
starting program
entering foo()
exiting foo()
entering bar()
exiting bar()
entering baz()
exiting baz()
ending program

After running the program I see that I am partially wrong because each print out
seems to hold itself inward. I was wrong because each of the definitions held
a call to each other definition. I was right about the entering and exiting 
program thing though because I am awesome.

When I removed the comments, I predicted that when foo runs, it would print 30
because it says to run bar before printing (x), and in bar, x==30. I then
then predicted that the next x value to print would be 1 after baz is called
because x==1 at the top and baz holds no x value. Then 10 would print because
we are brought back to the foo call and its value for x is 10.

I was right.

Go me!

	print (x)
