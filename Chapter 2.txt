Excercise 1
Python 3.4.1 (v3.4.1:c0e311e010fc, May 18 2014, 10:38:22) [MSC v.1600 32 bit 
(Intel)] on win32
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.
>>> n = 7
>>> 7 + 5
12
>>> 5.2, "this", 4 - 2. "that", 5/2.0
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>> 5.2, "this", 4 - 2, "that", 5/2.0
(5.2, 'this', 2, 'that', 2.5)
>>> 

A general rule for what can follow a print statement is a value or a statement.
A print statement will return what it is told to return, so if it is to print
("Hello World!) or just ("7 + 5") it will print exactly that. Without the print
command, Python will actuall calculate statements such as 7 + 5.

Took me a while to do this one.
